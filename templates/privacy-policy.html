        <p>Here at {{ site_name }} Office, doing business as {{ site_name }} (“Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”), we know that our users care about how your personal information is used and shared. We take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>By visiting or using the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, process and share your information as described herein.</p>
        <p>Any capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meaning given to them in the End User License Agreement: <a href="{% url 'downloader:terms-of-service' %}">terms of service</a> .</p>
        <p>I. PRIVACY PRINCIPLES</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy reflects the following three principles that we strive to uphold in providing you with the services on our Services:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>We will only collect information that helps us to improve our Services;</li>
        <li>You may provide and we only collect information that can identify you personally(“Personal Information”) in order to provide the Services;</li>
        <li>Our privacy practices will be transparent to you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>II. WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control (including, without limitation, the third party content providers from whom you may receive content through the Services), or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
        <p>Company does not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Website or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="//m.me/sheerif.abdullah/">m.me/sheerif.abdullah</a>.</p>
        <p>III. WHAT INFORMATION DOES {{ site_name }} COLLECT?</p>
        <p>The information we collect can be generally placed in two categories: 1) data on how the user uses our Services; 2) aggregate data on content the user engages with. We may use this information to personalize and improve our services, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. We may provide this information to our partners, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience, but we never disclose information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally. Here are a few examples of data we collect when you use our Services:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Whenever you interact with our website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your computer or device and tell us how and when the Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your computer or device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. We may use Google Analytics to gather non-Personal Information. In such cases, you may have the option to disable certain features as described below.</li>
